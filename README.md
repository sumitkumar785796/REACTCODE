•	React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

•	React is used to build single-page applications.

•	React allows us to create reusable UI components.

•	ReactJS is an open-source, component based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. 

•	It is maintained by Facebook.

•	ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill in data (views) in HTML DOM. 

•	The virtual DOM works fast owning to the fact that it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time.
